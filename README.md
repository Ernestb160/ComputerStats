# ComputerStats

This is computerstats, something cool i made that shows ur cpu and ram, displays over games too.
I built this little program to learn more about Tkinter and how it handles classes, system polling (with the help of psutil. I used AI for the boilerplate partially, ended up commenting parts out and customized the logic.

# **How to install**

## _For the program only_

Download the .exe and run it. 

## _For the source code_

Download the file.
Remember, psutil is NOT a default python library, make sure you use "pip install psutil" to install the needed library
